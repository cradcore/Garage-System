My garage system program consists of 6 classes and one data file

Classes: 
	AdminConsole
	Garage
	Gate
	RunSystem
	Ticket
	TicketDatabase
Data file:
	ticketDatabaseInfo.txt
	
To run this program, compile RunSystem.java and then run RunSystem.

This opens a menu with all of the required options
